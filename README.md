### Brokerage accounts

Most of the asset managers discussed in previous sections do not offer brokerage services, so their products must be purchased through other institutions. The brokers discussed so far are Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab. Other brokers in the US include E\*Trade, Ally Invest, and Interactive Brokers. Vanguard’s website is [difficult to use and inconsistent](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wp9c14/vanguard_does_it_again_with_their_ui/) compared to its peers, so even if you decide on Vanguard funds, I would suggest purchasing them as ETFs through Fidelity or Schwab. Those two are the brokers I recommend to most users. Feel free to create an account with each broker to experience the website and mobile app.

Before moving your money into a particular brokerage account, ensure that it is possible to buy shares in all of the funds you’re considering. Find out what fees, if any, the broker charges upon purchase and sale, and whether there is a minimum investment. If you choose a mainstream broker like Schwab or Fidelity, ETF trades will be free (a large ETF sale may cost a few cents due to [SEC regulations](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerssec31htm.html)). In a Schwab account, Schwab mutual funds are free to trade while Fidelity and Vanguard mutual funds carry transaction fees. Fidelity mutual funds are free to trade in a Fidelity account, and the same for Vanguard mutual funds in a Vanguard account. However, you may also be able to purchase shares through another broker: E\*Trade, for instance, offers no-fee access to some Vanguard mutual funds. Fidelity and Schwab mutual funds have no investment minimums; most Vanguard mutual funds have a $3,000 minimum.

If you want to switch brokers and you've already purchased securities, you can do an account transfer to avoid selling and triggering taxes. Usually, there is no fee to _sell_ shares of another manager's mutual funds (e.g., if you owned Fidelity mutual funds and transferred to a Schwab account). But before transferring mutual funds, you should verify that you can sell those specific funds without fees. Buying more shares will sometimes trigger expensive transaction fees, if you can buy them at all. ETFs have the advantage of making account transfers easier, because you don't have to manage a transition away from the mutual funds you can no longer buy.

Your previous broker may charge a fee to transfer out. You can ask your new broker to compensate you for the fee, which they may be willing to do, especially if you have a large account. If you're transferring cash only, it's likely that a wire transfer would be less expensive than an account transfer.

&nbsp;

### Cash and margin accounts

When you want to move money from investments to your bank account, the funds will not be available to withdraw until two business days after you sell the corresponding shares. So if you sold shares of a bond ETF on a Friday, the soonest you could transfer the money would be Tuesday morning (assuming no federal holidays; the time of day does not matter). This is due to the convention of a [two-day settlement period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement_period.asp).

This restriction can be lifted: if you enable margin features in your account, you can transfer funds immediately after selling, up to a certain portion of your total account value. With a [margin account](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_marginaccount), you can also sell shares of an ETF and immediately buy shares of a new one, instead of waiting two days in a cash account. For these reasons, I recommend enabling margin in your account. By law, a minimum of $2,000 is required to activate margin features. Margin accounts allow you to borrow funds from your broker (and pay interest), which is not a practice I would suggest for most investors. Stock and bond mutual fund trades generally settle within only one business day (e.g., a sale is executed on Monday evening and the funds settle on Tuesday). Margin accounts also allow you to [sell short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAs_aX95tVQ), which is not something the average investor needs to know how to do.

All things considered, a margin account is arguably simpler to use than a cash account. The chief concerns with using each type of account are the following.

Cash account:
* good faith violations
* freeriding violations
* cash liquidation violations

Margin account:
* pattern day trader designation
* unwittingly borrowing money

The cash account violations are described [here](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/avoiding-cash-trading-violations). Good faith violations are the main hazard. You can still sell and buy on the same day in a cash account, as long as you don't sell again before the first trade settles.

Before describing the pattern day trader rule, we should define a day trade. A day trade means that you opened and closed a given [position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/position.asp) on the same day. Here's a day trade: you buy shares of XY on Wednesday and sell some or all of the shares on Wednesday. This is _not_ a day trade: you buy shares of XY on Wednesday, sell them on Thursday, buy more shares of XY later on Thursday, and sell them on Friday. On Thursday you closed a position then opened another; you didn't open and close a position on the same day. The [pattern day trader](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/introduction-to-pattern-day-trader-rules) rule dictates that a broker must label you a pattern day trader (PDT) if you execute at least four day trades within a rolling period of five business days. Why does it matter? After this designation, you'll be required to maintain an account value of at least $25K at all times. For many people, this would be an issue. Your broker is likely willing to remove the designation once or even a few times, but you need to know how to avoid it if your account is worth less than $25K or might fall below that threshold during a downturn.

Second, don't spend more cash than is available in your account (assuming you want to avoid borrowing money). Different brokers use different words for the same concepts, so you may want to call your broker to clarify terminology. Borrowing money is not legally allowed in a tax-advantaged account, so instead of margin, you'll have access to [limited margin](https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/library/margin/how-to-trade-margin-ira) in your IRA. This allows you to trade without worrying about settlement periods, but naturally does not permit you to invest with borrowed money. Your broker may require a minimum of $25K in the account.

Margin is an account feature that you need to apply for. This is a risk management tactic on their part to ensure their clients aren't putting themselves in debt by signing up for margin without any understanding. Your broker will ask about your knowledge of and experience with investing (e.g., years of experience). Without suggesting anything, it's [not unheard of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSz67F0ZS0w&t=139s) to exaggerate one's net worth or experience in order to ensure that you'll be approved for margin.

&nbsp;

### Is my money safe?

Many people are aware that bank accounts in the US are insured by the [FDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation) up to $250K per account. Client assets at US brokerage firms are also insured, but there are many regulations intended to protect client assets before insurance is ever needed:

"In virtually all cases, when a brokerage firm ceases to operate, customer assets are safe and typically are transferred in an orderly fashion to another registered brokerage firm. Multiple layers of protection safeguard investor assets. For example, registered brokerage firms must keep their customers' securities and cash segregated from their own so that, even if a firm fails, its customers' assets will be safe. Brokerage firms are also required to meet minimum net capital requirements to reduce the likelihood of insolvency, and to be members of the [Securities Investor Protection Corp (SIPC)](https://www.sipc.org/), which protects customer securities accounts up to $500,000. SIPC protection comes into play in those rare cases of firm failure where customer assets are missing because of theft or fraud."

You can read more [here](https://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/if-brokerage-firm-closes-its-doors) from FINRA. Note that securities in each account are insured up to $500K. So a client's taxable account, Roth IRA, and traditional IRA at the same firm are each covered up to $500K. Splitting assets between different firms is not necessary even for those with more than $500K per account.

If an asset manager like BlackRock were to fail, either the fund would be transferred to another manager or the assets would be liquidated and returned to shareholders. Your money is safe.

### Cash positions

Your money being uninvested might seem too simple to bother addressing. But uninvested cash is actually one of the [major](https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-stock-trades-go-free-but-your-cash-is-in-chains-11570199582) [sources](https://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-schwab-paying-186-million-in-regulatory-settlement-over-robo-adviser-business-11655128036) of revenue for brokers, especially since trading commissions were [eliminated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-schwab-ending-online-trading-commissions-on-u-s-listed-products-11569935983) in 2019.
-->

&nbsp;

### Order types

There are two basic order types everyone needs to know: [market order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketorder.asp) and [limit order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp). A market order means you'll buy or sell shares immediately, at the best price your broker can arrange. A limit order does the same, but only if the available price is at least as good as the limit you specified. So when you're buying shares, the order will execute only when the price is at your limit or _lower_. When you're selling shares, it will execute only when the price is at your limit or _higher_.

Ensure that you understand the [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) before you submit any orders. If an ETF has a bid price of $80.14 and an ask price of $80.16, a market order to buy shares will likely execute at $80.16. If you decide to set a limit order for $80.11, there are two possibilities: (a) your order will execute when the ask price falls to $80.11, or (b) your order will never execute because the ask price never fell to $80.11. One way of using a limit order is to set the limit at the current ask price (if you're buying) or bid price (if you're selling), to avoid any surprises about the price at which your trade is executed. The ETFs recommended here are usually not highly volatile, so a market order is harmless. 

If you place an order to buy or sell while the market is closed, it will be submitted at 9:30am when the market opens on the next business day. If it's a market order, it will execute at whatever the day's opening price is. This price can occasionally be _very_ different than the closing price on the prior trading day. But if you only have the chance to invest your money in the evenings or on weekends, submitting a market order is fine as long as you understand that the execution price could surprise you in either direction.

Trading is most active after the market opens at 9:30am and as the close approaches at 4pm. If you buy new ETF shares between 11:30am and 1:30pm, it's likely that price movement will be relatively low. This doesn't mean it's a mistake to trade near market open or close, but some people might find it mentally easier to execute trades when prices are stable. If you want to make it as easy as possible, __feel free to just submit market orders for everything__.

When you submit an order, it will either expire at the end of the day (a [day order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dayorder.asp)) or will be [Good 'Til Canceled](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gtc.asp) (GTC). Most of the time this distinction will not matter, because your orders should execute quickly. I don't recommend trying to wait multiple days for price improvement by using a limit order: just submit your orders and keep it simple.

None of this applies to mutual funds: there is no bid-ask spread and trades can occur only once per day.

### Large price drops and distributions — don't panic

Some funds may have large distributions at the end of the year, triggering unusually large price drops. (If you need a refresher on dividends and price drops, [click here](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f5).) Take Vanguard's total international bond fund (BNDX) as an example. Throughout 2021, monthly dividends [ranged](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndx#distributions) from 3-4 cents per share. The price changes due to these distributions were barely noticeable. On December 22, the closing price was $57.10. Then on the morning of December 23, the price [opened](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNDX/history?period1=1640044800&period2=1640822400&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true) at $55.35, falling 3%. These drops can be a source of dismay for new investors who think they rapidly lost this money in what they considered a safe bond fund. On December 29, shareholders saw a large distribution land in their account. Following a dividend of three cents per share at the beginning of December, the fund's end of year distribution was composed of a dividend of $1.25 per share, long-term capital gains of 36 cents per share, and short-term capital gains of half a cent per share (totaling about $1.62 per share).

This section is simply meant to warn you about a price drop you may (or may not!) observe in some of your funds at the end of each year. You can always check the ex-dividend date and payment date ahead of time. Schwab has the best interface for viewing this information, because they make it very easy to see the dates and composition of different distributions. Just type the ticker symbol in their website's search bar and click the "Distributions & Yields" section. (You need a Schwab account to use this feature, though it need not be funded.) You can also check distributions from previous years, because a fund's schedule of distributions tends to be very uniform over time.

&nbsp;

### Dividends and rebalancing

It is advisable to select the option to reinvest dividends and capital gains distributions in your settings. For some people with small portfolios, each round of dividends will be so small that their sum may not even be enough to purchase a single share of an ETF. In that case, keep it simple and adjust your settings so that all dividends are automatically reinvested.

Alternatively, you could refrain from automatically reinvesting and use each dividend as an opportunity to partially [rebalance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp) your portfolio. You would buy shares in the most underweighted fund, and avoid reinvesting dividends in overweighted funds. You can use the same approach when investing your earned income (i.e., salary or wages) to add to underweighted funds. Rebalancing through dividends and earned income is advantageous because you can do so without selling any shares. Being able to hold shares for more than a year without selling is ideal in taxable accounts, because you'll pay lower taxes on [long-term capital gains](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes). Depending on how much earned income flows into your portfolio, you may be able to keep it balanced according to your preferences with dividends and earned income. All rebalancing actions should be conducted with [tax implications](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) in mind.

Either way, most people are best served by not treating dividends as a form of immediate income, but rather as a portion of their shares which they were forced to sell. (See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ) on the irrelevance of dividends.)

Time-based rebalancing may occur on a quarterly, semi-annual, or annual schedule. You might also rebalance if your allocation drifts past a threshold (e.g., when a fund strays by more than 5 percentage points from its intended proportion). According to a [Vanguard paper](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/isggbot_a-042019.pdf), the specific method does not much matter if you remain consistent: 

> What’s remarkable is that starkly different strategies were equally successful in controlling risk. At one extreme is a monthly 0% threshold strategy. If portfolio allocations differ at all from their target at month-end, the portfolio is rebalanced. Over the past 92 years, this strategy would have rebalanced a portfolio more than 1,100 times to produce an annualized return of 8.20%. At the other extreme is an annual 10% threshold strategy. The portfolio is evaluated yearly and rebalanced only if allocations differ from their target by more than 10 percentage points. This strategy led to only 14 rebalancing events, also producing an annualized return of 8.20%. We see that most rebalancing strategies have historically produced similar returns and Sharpe ratios on an after-tax basis.

Based on research like this, I would suggest a restrained approach to rebalancing, rather than trying to keep your portfolio perfectly weighted at all times.

&nbsp;

### Fractional shares

Fidelity is the only major broker that offers fractional shares for all ETFs (as well as stocks). Vanguard is piloting a feature to allow fractional shares for Vanguard ETFs only. Schwab offers fractional shares only for S&P 500 stocks, so it's not currently possible to purchase fractional ETF shares through Schwab.

If you decide to use fractional shares, you should be aware of a few details. Dealing in fractional shares may mean that your trade cannot be executed instantly in full, because the broker purchases your whole shares immediately but needs to combine your fractional share with those owned by others. The Plain Bagel's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3oZOg9yRuY) on this is a great explanation. Since mainstream ETFs are rarely volatile, this will not matter in the vast majority of cases, but you should be aware of it. No matter how many ETFs are in an allocation plan, it is necessary to buy only one fractional share, and this is wise even if it means that the proportions will not be perfect.

It is easiest to buy a fractional share of the fund with the most assets under management, because this is likely to be the most liquid (i.e., quickly tradable at minimal cost). The 30-day median bid-ask spread is a more direct way of assessing liquidity than assets under management, because the bid-ask spread is the cost you pay to trade. Lower is better. In the most liquid ETFs, the median spread will be .01% or may even round down to .00%. Selecting a large ETF with a very low bid-ask spread is likely to lead to an immediate execution of the fractional trade. After your initial allocation you will eventually need to invest more money into your funds, because you've earned income or received dividends. You may want to always use the money left over after purchasing whole shares to purchase a fractional share of the most liquid fund, but this is not essential, as long as you understand that the trade may not execute instantly and that the price can change in the intervening seconds. However, you can use a [limit order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) instead of a market order to prevent any surprises about the share price; this is good practice in general.

&nbsp;

### Mutual funds

For logistical and financial reasons, some mutual funds prohibit frequent trading. Before you start using your employer-sponsored retirement plan, you should find out whether your plan provider has restrictions against frequent trading. There are no such restrictions on ETF trading (although ETFs are rarely offered by employer-sponsored plans).

In contrast to stocks and ETFs, mutual funds are not traded during market hours. Instead, once you submit an order to buy or sell shares of a mutual fund, the order will not execute until the conclusion of market hours. The order cutoff time is usually 4pm ET. Remember: _if you submit a buy or sell order after 4pm, it will not execute that day_. Another day of trading will occur before the order is executed after market hours. An order can be cancelled until 4pm on the day it will be executed.

At 4:05pm on (say) a Friday, even though the market is closed, you won't be able to see the day's updated price (also known as the [NAV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp)). It will still show the price from the end of day on Thursday. The new price will be published between 5pm and 6pm. You can check it in your brokerage account, on the fund [webpage](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swagx), or on a third-party website like [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SWAGX).

Before buying any mutual fund you should ensure that there are no extra conditions, like a [short-term redemption fee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redemptionfee.asp). Such fees may depend on which broker you use. __Yet another advantage of ETFs is that you don't have to worry about potentially surprising fees.__ For example, Vanguard's fixed income mutual funds [VGAVX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vgavx) and [VBLAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vblax) have purchase fees to disincentivize rapid trading — even if you trade in a Vanguard account — but their ETF counterparts [VWOB](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vwob) and [BLV](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/blv) have no such fees.

If you want to move money from one mutual fund to another, it's not ideal to sell shares and then buy shares after the sell order has executed. If you sell on a Monday, your order will execute after hours and you'll have cash on Tuesday. Once you buy shares on Tuesday, your order will execute after hours and you'll have missed the entire day's movement. Since the movement tends to be upward, we want to avoid this. Instead of selling, we can select "exchange". This will allow us to sell and buy shares after hours on Monday without missing Tuesday. Schwab phrases this option clearly: select "sell and buy another" to perform an exchange in a Schwab account.
