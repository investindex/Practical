# Practical information for execution

#### Brokerage accounts

Most of the fund providers do not offer brokerage services, so their products must be purchased through other institutions. You can (but do not need to) create a Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab brokerage account to use their products. E\*Trade is an additional example of a broker through which you could buy shares of some funds. As discussed earlier, a Fidelity account offers the advantage of trading fractional shares of ETFs. Vanguard’s website is difficult to use compared to its peers, so even if you decide on Vanguard funds, I would suggest purchasing them as ETFs through Fidelity or Schwab. Feel free to create an account with each broker to experience the website and mobile app.

Before moving your money into a particular brokerage account, ensure that it is possible to buy shares in all of the funds you’re considering. Find out what fees, if any, the broker charges upon purchase and sale, and whether there is a minimum investment. If you choose a mainstream broker like Schwab or Fidelity, ETF and mutual fund trades will be free (a large ETF sale may cost a few cents due to [SEC regulations](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerssec31htm.html)). In a Schwab account, Schwab mutual funds are free to trade while Fidelity and Vanguard mutual funds carry transaction fees. Fidelity mutual funds are free to trade in a Fidelity account, and the same for Vanguard mutual funds in a Vanguard account. Fidelity and Schwab mutual funds have no investment minimums; most Vanguard mutual funds have a $3,000 minimum.

The money from your first transfer may not be available to trade with for a few business days. Later transfers often become available more promptly. When you want to move money from investments to your bank account, the funds will not be available to withdraw until [two business days](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement_period.asp) after you sell the corresponding shares. So if you sold shares of a bond ETF on a Friday, the soonest you could transfer the money would be Tuesday morning (assuming no federal holidays; the time of day does not matter). This restriction can be lifted: if you enable margin features in your account, you can transfer funds immediately after selling, up to a certain portion of your total account value. With a [margin account](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_marginaccount), you can also sell shares of an ETF and immediately buy shares of a new one, instead of waiting two days in a cash account. For these reasons, I recommend enabling margin in your account. By law, a minimum of $2,000 is required to activate margin features. Ensure that you understand how margin works, even if you need to call your broker to clarify terminology — different brokers use different words for the same concepts. Margin accounts allow you to borrow funds from your broker (and pay interest), which is not a practice I would suggest for most investors. Stock and bond mutual fund trades generally settle within only one business day (e.g., a sale is executed on Monday evening and the funds settle on Tuesday).

#### Dividends and rebalancing

It is advisable to select the option to reinvest dividends and capital gains distributions in your settings. It will increase the shares you own and magnify compounding growth. Alternatively, you could refrain from automatically reinvesting and use each dividend as an opportunity to partially [rebalance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp) your portfolio. Either way, most people are best served by not treating dividends as a form of immediate income, but rather as a portion of their shares which they were forced to sell. (See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ&ab_channel=BenFelix) on the irrelevance of dividends.)

An example of rebalancing from dividends will be useful. Let's say we have a three-fund portfolio of Stock Fund X and Stock Fund Y (35% each) which distribute quarterly dividends and Bond Fund Z (30%) which distributes monthly dividends. We invest at the beginning of June, and the share price of Stock Fund X rises throughout the month, while the share prices of Stock Fund Y and Bond Fund Z fall slightly. We then receive dividends from all three funds and decide to reinvest them. The weights of each fund have shifted from 35%/35%/30% to 39%/34%/27%. (That's a large move for only one month, but this makes it easier to illustrate the point.) Bond funds becoming underweighted is common because stock funds usually grow more quickly in [bull markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp). So instead of simply reinvesting each fund's dividends in the same fund, we invest most of the new cash in Bond Fund Z to move its allocation closer to the intended 30%, and a smaller portion in Stock Fund Y. We reinvest none in Stock Fund X. After reinvestment we've shifted our allocation from 39%/34%/27% to 36%/35%/29%, which is very close to our intended allocation. Of course, be aware that if you do not immediately reinvest each fund's dividends back into the same fund, the performance you observe will not match its [total return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp).

You can use the same approach when investing your earned income (i.e., salary or wages) to add to underweighted portions of your portfolio. Rebalancing through dividends and earned income is advantageous because it means you can do so without selling any shares. Being able to hold shares for more than a year without selling is ideal in taxable accounts, because you'll pay lower taxes on [long-term capital gains](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes). Depending on your portfolio and how much earned income flows into it, you may be able to keep it balanced according to your preferences with dividends and earned income. After holding shares for more than a year, you can easily rebalance by selling shares in overweighted funds and buying more shares of underweighted funds. Alternatively, some people prefer to let their successful holdings grow without adjustment. If you decide to do this, be aware that it will alter the risk-return properties of the portfolio. Most notably, not rebalancing [usually leads](https://about.vanguard.com/what-sets-vanguard-apart/principles-for-investing-success/ISGPRINC_062020_Online.pdf#page=27) to overweighting of stocks and underweighting of bonds, which implies that the portfolio has become riskier. This may be acceptable, but you should regularly re-evaluate whether the risk of your portfolio is suitable to your financial situation.

When rebalancing on a schedule, quarterly is the most common frequency. You might also rebalance if your allocation drifts past certain thresholds. For example, in the 35%/35%/30% example above, you might rebalance whenever a fund strays by more than 5 percentage points from its intended proportion. All rebalancing actions should be conducted with [tax implications](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) in mind.

#### Fractional shares

If you decide to use fractional shares through Fidelity, you should be aware of a few details. Dealing in fractional shares may mean that your trade cannot be executed instantly in full, because the broker purchases your whole shares immediately but needs to combine your fractional share with those owned by others. The Plain Bagel's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3oZOg9yRuY&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) on this is a great explanation. Since mainstream ETFs are rarely volatile, this will not matter in the vast majority of cases, but you should be aware of it. No matter how many ETFs are in an allocation plan, it is necessary to buy only one fractional share, and this is wise even if it means that the proportions will not be perfect.

It is easiest to buy a fractional share of the fund with the most assets under management, because this is likely to be the most liquid (i.e., quickly tradable at minimal cost). The 30-day median bid-ask spread is a more direct way of assessing liquidity than assets under management, because the bid-ask spread is the cost you pay to trade. Lower is better. In the most liquid ETFs, the median spread will be .01% or may even round down to .00%. Selecting a large ETF with a very low bid-ask spread is likely to lead to an immediate execution of the fractional trade. After your initial allocation you will eventually need to invest more money into your funds, because you've earned income or received dividends. You may want to always use the money left over after purchasing whole shares to purchase a fractional share of the most liquid fund, but this is not essential, as long as you understand that the trade may not execute instantly and that the price can change in the intervening seconds. However, you can use a [limit order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) instead of a market order to prevent any surprises about the share price; this is good practice in general.

Trading is most active after the market opens at 9:30am and as the close approaches at 4pm. If you buy new ETF shares between 11:30am and 1:30pm, it's likely that price movement will be relatively low. This doesn't mean it's a mistake to trade near market open or close — liquidity is actually highest when trading volume is high (i.e., bid-ask spreads are small) — but some people might find it easier to implement trades for multiple ETFs when they have a good idea of what the price will be for each.

Schwab offers fractional shares only for S&P 500 stocks, so it's not currently possible to purchase fractional ETF shares through Schwab.

#### Mutual funds

In contrast to stocks and ETFs, mutual funds are not traded during market hours. Instead, once you submit an order to buy or sell shares of a mutual fund, the order will not execute until the conclusion of market hours. The order cutoff time is 4pm ET. Remember: _if you submit a buy or sell order after 4pm, it will not execute that day_. Another day of trading will occur before the order is executed after market hours. An order can be cancelled until 4pm on the day it will be executed.

At 4:05pm on (say) a Friday, even though the market is closed, you won't be able to see the day's updated price (also known as the [NAV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp)). It will still show the price from the end of day on Thursday. The new price will be published between 5pm and 6pm. You can check it in your brokerage account, on the fund [webpage](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swagx), or on a third-party website like [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SWAGX).

If you want to move money from one mutual fund to another, it's not ideal to sell and then buy shares. If you sell on a Monday, your order will execute after hours and you'll have cash on Tuesday. Once you buy shares on Tuesday, your order will execute after hours and you'll have missed the entire day's movement. Since the movement tends to be upward, we want to avoid this. Instead of selling, we can select "exchange". This will allow us to sell and buy shares after hours on Monday without missing Tuesday. Schwab phrases this option clearly: select "sell and buy another" to perform an exchange in a Schwab account.

For logistical and financial reasons, mutual funds prohibit frequent trading. Fidelity mutual funds suspend users from purchasing further shares for 85 days if their [rules](http://personal.fidelity.com/products/trading/Trading_Platforms_Tools/excessive_trading_policies.shtml) are violated. A single, occasional sale within 30 days of a purchase is acceptable. Suspension will occur if you sell shares within 30 days of a purchase more than once within a 90-day period. They will never block sales, only purchases. Trades of $1,000 or less are exempt from this policy and will never trigger a block. There are no such restrictions on ETF trading.
